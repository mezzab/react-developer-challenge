# React Dev Challenge

The idea of this challenge is to evaluate your skills as a **React Developer**.

If you want to apply to this position, please send the following to **jobs at exact dot ly**:

1. The URL with the app up and running
2. Your solution in a **_private repository_**

The team will review your solution only if the online app you send does [all requirements requested here](#the-app-should-be-able-to).

## The app should be able to:

Required technologies to be used: Sass, React and TypeScript. You can use CSS-like frameworks like [MUI](https://mui.com/) if you want.

1. List the top five assets traded in [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) sorted by Market Cap (descending sort) in a table. Show whatever information you consider appropriate.
2. Separately, show historic price graph (in USD) for the assets listed in the previous table. User should be able to change assets and time frame to be shown (1 day, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 5 years). time in X-axis, price in Y-axis.

These are the minimum requirements, you can add whatever you want to make the app more appealing.

## Think about

- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?
- Think about the UX, minimize the number of interactions to use the application
- Take care of your environment variables

## Criteria

The things that we will pay attention to are:

- Commit history
- Comments in the code
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility
- Good practices (e.g.: typing all elements in the app, et al)

## Desirable but not required

The challenge finishes here, but if you add one or more of the following features we will consider them as a big plus üëç

- Adding web3 capabilites like connecting a wallet and showing your assets balance
- Add unit tests, with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for functions and/or [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for components
- Add integration tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or similar testing frameworks
